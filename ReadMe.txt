#LinearRegressionTensorflow
    This program explores how to maintain learning rate and epochs

#FeatureCrossesInTensorFlow
     In this program we explore different ways to represent features.
           Use tf.feature_column methods to represent features in different ways.
           Represent features as bins.
           cross bins to create a feature cross.
